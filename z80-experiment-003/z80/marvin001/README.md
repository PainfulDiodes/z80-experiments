# marvin - a tiny Z80 monitor program
The original version was needs to operate entirely within RAM   
which was first run using an Arduino Mega to provide RAM to the Z80

This version was altered to run in ROM, separating stack and buffer into RAM
The original version had an error in that it assumed the stack worked up from a given memory location
This version understand that the stack works downward though memory and so starts at 0xffff
Technically this should be 0x0000 as the first PUSH will decrement the SP to 0xffff
